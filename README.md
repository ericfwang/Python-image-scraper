# Python-image-scraper
(Python: pandas, seaborn, and selenium) Improvement on Fabian Bosler's Google image scraper that uses Python's selenium. I augmented his code using pandas and seaborn to scrape logos from a list of 2,000 colleges in an Excel spreadsheet and then visualize how successful the scraping was. This was pro bono work for Moneythink, a non-profit I volunteer for.
